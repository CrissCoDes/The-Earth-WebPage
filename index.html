                <h3>The Planet Earth</h3>
                <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known
                     to harbor life. While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar
                      System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface
                       is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers.!</p>

                <h3>The Earth Moon</h3>
                <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Together with Earth it forms the Earth-Moon
                     satellite system. It is about one-quarter of Earth in diameter (comparable to the width
                      of Australia).[16] In the Solar System it is the fifth largest satellite, larger than 
                      any of the known dwarf planets and the largest (and most massive) satellite of a planet
                       relative to the planet.[</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>The Planet Mercury</h3>
                <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit 
                    around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named 
                    after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator
                     between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>The Planet Venus</h3>
                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
                     As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows 
                     and can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>The Planet Mars</h3>
                <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being
                     larger than only Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars 
                     is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, and has a crust primarily composed of elements 
                     similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel.</p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>The Planet Jupiter</h3>
                <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant 
                    with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System 
                    combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>The Planet Saturn</h3>
                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.
                     It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has 
                     only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 
                     95 times more massive.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>The Planet Uranus</h3>
                <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky,
                     Uranus (Caelus), who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars),
                      grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary 
                      radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>The Planet Neptune</h3>
                <p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known solar planet. In the Solar System,
                     it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant
                      planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. </p>
